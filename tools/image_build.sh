# This script is responsible for building a new GCP image that: 1) has nested
# virtualization enabled, and 2) has been completely set up with the
# image_setup.sh script. This script should be idempotent, as we memoize the
# setup script with a hash and check for that name.
#
# The GCP project name should be defined via a gcloud config.
